Well, thats it. Daft Punk called it quits. It felt appropriate to start my blog with the end.
It all started with this image, when [MKBHD](https://www.youtube.com/mkbhd) showed it in one of his videos.

I fell in love with this image and began researching what this *Daft Punk* is. 
So I started with Random Access Memories as it was most recent album. 

What. A. Blast.

I totaly jumped on the hype train. I didn't listen to anything different for at least 4 weeks.
It fueled my nights at the computer furiously bashing my keyboard to the rhytms. Sometimes school assignments, but mostly games.
In the same time range Pharrel Williams released Happy, so I was swithing between RAM and [Happy](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i0A3-wc0rpw). 
These are the only songs I rembember I listened to in 2013-2014. 
Halfway through the 2014 it became repetitive. "Wow these robots are active since the time I was born!" and so begun my journey through older Daft Punk albums.
And then it hit me. As I was flying through the songs, I regonised **Technologic**, **Harder Better Faster** and **One More Time**.
Every time I recognized new song I died a little inside, because I felt the regret of not researching Daft Punk sooner.

After another 6 - 12 months my Daft Punk craze fell down, but the robots stayed in my heart forever.
New artist came with new songs, but I always knew I could count Daft Punk to help me with all-nighter.

## The Epilogue
It is funny thing to think about. That my first contact with Daft Punk began with their last album. 
But I kept some goodies in my to-checkout list. Interstella 5555, Electroma and some documentaries. 
I didn't care enough to watch these, I just came for the music.
I just hope for one more world tour so I could experience the robots.
